# SIH Cyclone Vision

## Overview
End-to-end computer vision system developed during **Smart India Hackathon (SIH)** for cyclone prediction and geospatial mapping, integrated with ISRO’s SCORPIO platform.

## Approach
- Satellite image preprocessing and data handling
- CNN-based modeling for cyclone-related vision tasks
- GeoTIFF coordinate extraction and mapping
- Web interface for visualization and interaction

## Tech Stack
Python, Deep Learning (CNNs), Geospatial Data, Flask/Django, React

## Notes
This project was built as part of a national-level hackathon and focuses on practical deployment and system integration rather than purely academic modeling.
